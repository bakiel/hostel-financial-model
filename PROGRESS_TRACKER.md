- ✅ Set up working directory at /Users/mac/Projects/hostel-financial-model
- ✅ Established communication with PM (Window 0)
- ✅ Created requirements.txt with necessary Python packages
- ✅ Developed initial Python financial model generator script
- ✅ Explored tmux orchestrator system and communication methods
- ✅ Installed missing dependencies (seaborn)
- ✅ **Generated initial Excel financial model** (hostel_diary_financial_model.xlsx)

## Completed Tasks (Last Hour)
1. Created comprehensive Python script (hostel_financial_model.py) with:
   - Revenue projection calculations
   - Operating expense modeling
   - Break-even analysis
   - Multi-year projections (3 years)
   - Excel workbook generation with multiple sheets
   - Formatting and styling capabilities

2. Implemented key features:
   - Room type configuration (dorm and private rooms)
   - Seasonal occupancy variations
   - Growth and inflation factors
   - Monthly and yearly summaries

3. Reviewed existing code structure:
   - Model supports 50 beds total
   - 4 room types: 4-bed dorm ($25), 6-bed dorm ($20), private single ($60), private double ($80)
   - Includes seasonality patterns and occupancy rates
   - Operating expenses modeled (staff, utilities, maintenance, supplies, marketing)

4. **NEW**: Successfully generated Excel financial model
   - File: hostel_diary_financial_model.xlsx (9.3KB)
   - Contains projections, summary, assumptions, and dashboard sheets
   - 3-year financial projections with monthly breakdowns

## Next Steps
1. ✅ ~~Install Python dependencies~~ (DONE)
2. ✅ ~~Run the financial model generator to create initial Excel file~~ (DONE)
3. Review generated Excel file for accuracy and completeness
4. Enhance with scenario analysis (best/base/worst case)
5. Add dynamic dashboards and charts
6. Create documentation
7. Implement sensitivity analysis
8. Add cash flow projections

## PM Action Required
The initial financial model has been generated. Please review:
- hostel_diary_financial_model.xlsx (in project directory)
- Verify assumptions are correct (50 beds, room rates, occupancy rates)
- Provide feedback on additional features needed

## Questions for PM
1. ~~Should I proceed with creating a new model or wait for existing files?~~ (Proceeded with new model)
2. Are the default assumptions accurate?
   - 50 total beds
   - Room rates: 4-bed dorm ($25), 6-bed dorm ($20), private single ($60), private double ($80)
   - Occupancy: Low season (65%), Mid season (75%), High season (85%)
3. Any specific KPIs or metrics to prioritize?
4. Should I add scenario analysis next?
